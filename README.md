# Mixed Messages
## Project from CodeCademy  

### Instructions
*For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.*

### Project Objectives:
+ Build a message generator program using JavaScript
+ Use Git version control
+ Use command line
+ Develop locally on your computer

### Prerequisites:
+ JavaScript
+ Git and GitHub
+ Command line

## Plan
### Inspiration
>My project will be an ingredient generator.  This is inspired by an actual idea for a program I had a long time ago to randomly generate an ingredient.  The purpose of this is to jog your creativity when thinking about food by suggesting outside the box food pairings.  

### Description
>The program will randomly select from an array of ingredients, preparations, and flavorings.  Each time it is run, it will return a uniquely flavored and prepared ingredient in message format.  There will be over 100 items in each array, making each output item one in a million.  

### Outside Research
>For research,  I plan to consult the book *The Flavor Bible* for its list of ingredients, preparations, and seasonings.

### Tools
>This project will be built using Javascript.  To use, simply run the program through the terminal and it will return your message.

### Timeline
>I plan to complete this project over the course of one day.

## Results
>As of this commit, the program is functional and has a good base of ingredients, preparations, and flavorings.  It does a good job of creating new food ideas, as intended.  Although the returned food ideas are occasionally silly sounding, they still make you think, which is the purpose.

## Improvements
>This program could use more inputs (i.e. ingredients, etc).  Furthermore, better organiation of the inputs would be helpful.
>A big improvement would be a way to import lists and check for duplicates.
